# CIT|ANALYSIS
# INTRODUCTION

## MAIN IDEA OF THIS PLUGIN
**This plugin is aiming to clarify the relationship between the community healthcare and the residence.**
- *Where is the zone of residence/community healthcare?*
- *What's the catchment radius for their network?their concentration area?*
- *The reflection/development prospect/Provision of public facilities/convenience?*

- *What can be better if the city system have change?*
- *How can people get the healthcare at once?*
- *Provide a guideline/planning tool for people to catch the fastest treatment*

# Overview of the plug-in

CIT|ANALYSIS plug-in is developed into 8 sections.
- *Section 1：Mapping Datasets——choose one city osm map for planning*
- *Section 2：Brief Summary——Concluding community healthcare types and amounts*
- *Section 3 ： Brief Summary——Concluding residence areas types and amounts*
- *Section 4 : Amounts analysis——Counting how many community healthcare organizations and residence areas are existing*
- *Section 5 : Density Analysis——residence area and community healthcare*
- *Section 6 : Distance Analysis——Specify the minimum//maximum distances from different community healthcare organization to residence areas*
- *Section 7 ： Location Analysis——Summary different kinds of community healthcare organization with their name-tags*
- *Section 8 : Time Analysis : Specify the community healthcare organization for long-time emergency treatment*

# Use Instruction
**This plug-in is mainly using the Grasshopper Structure of Proximity |Metaball Parametric |Circles.While the components had been settle down,users do not need to make some changes except for what have mentioned**

- *Using Mexico city as an example:*
- *STEP 1.choose a map for discovery

- *STEP 2.check the existing amounts of residence area/community healthcare in the chosen area

- *STEP 3.Use graphic to show how many community healthcare organizations and residence areas are existed and how many hospitals have the emergency

- *STEP 4.Use circle CNR to specify the density of healthcare facilities

- *STEP 5.Use Proximity to analysis the closed point from residence area to healthcare area by distance

- *STEP 6.Use Name-tag Indicate the location of three major medical facilities

- *STEP 7.Analysis how many emergency in the hoitial and how many are not with name-tag explain

# Future planning based on this plugin

- *For Publications:CIT | ANALYSIS is a tool testing for helping the public to reach the needed medical institutions within the shortest possible time, help them to find out where is the closed healthcare facilities and how many of the facilities are surrounding their living area.the usage of the plug-in is simple and convenient, meet the demand of daily life. Even people who don't know how to operate Grasshopper can get information from Component's explanations*


- *For Urban planners/landscape designers:For landscape architects, You can use the plugin analysis of the existing network of medical institutions in the city, through the radiation scope of medical institutions stationing position to plan for the future of medical institutions, but also can deepen the development from medical institutions to the actual distance of residential communities, citizens can use what kind of tools (public transportation/car/on foot) to get a more convenient way to the healthcare facilities.

- *For Government or design department:Based on this helathcare analysis system,they can have a future plan for the Medical Institution planning and try to plan more hospital equipment for opening emergency outpatient department when circumstances permit, and add a variety of medical equipment, such as community service hospitals, elderly centers, children's hospitals, clinics for the disabled, etc

# Graph Description
- *The first graph shows Amounts of existing emergency in the hospitals.
- *The second graph shows Amounts of community healthcare.
